1. Requirements
===============

Gource's display is rendered using OpenGL and requires a 3D accelerated video card to run.

2. Installation
===============

You can either build Gource from scratch or install a pre-compiled binary version from the homepage (recommended).

3. Using Gource
===============

gource <options> <path>

options:

    -f      Fullscreen

    -WIDTHxHEIGHT

    -p, --start-position POSITION
            Begin at some position in the log (between 0.0 and 1.0).

    -a, --auto-skip-seconds SECONDS
            Automatically skip to next entry if nothing happens for a specified number of seconds.

    --max-user-speed UNITS
            Max speed users can travel per second.

    --user-friction SECONDS

    --hide-filenames
            Hide filenames.

    --hide-date

    path    Either a git directory, a pre-generated log file (see --git-log-command, --cvs-exp-command or the custom
            log format) or '-' to read STDIN. If path is ommited gource will attempt to read a git log from the current directory.

Git Examples:

View the log of the Git respository in the current path:

    gource

View the log of a Git project in the specified directory:

    gource my-project-dir

Save a copy of the log using in a special git-log format and play it back. Use --git-log-command to get the git-log
options you should use:

    cd my-git-project
    `gource --git-log-command` > my-git-project.log
    gource my-git-project.log

NOTE: --git-log-command assumes you have a recent version git of that supports all the options. You may need to modify
the command line to work with an older version (changing %aN to %an for instance).

CVS Support:

You can view CVS projects with gource using the tool cvs-exp (not provided) with the command line specified by the
--cvs-exp-command option:

    cd my-cvs-project
    `gource --cvs-exp-command` > my-cvs-project.log
    gource my-cvs-project.log

SVN Support via Git:

SVN is not supported directly, however you could can import your project into a Git repository using the 'git svn' command.

The below insturctions will work if your SVN repository has the standard three directories - trunk, tags and branches
(Otherwise, see the 'git svn' documentation):

    git svn init --stdlayout https://myrepo.example.org/svn my-repo.git
    cd my-repo.git
    git svn fetch

Note that the last command (git svn fetch) can take hours if your repository is large.

You can pull new changes into the Git copy of your SVN repository at any time using the following command:

    git svn rebase

Support for Other Systems:

Please check the Gource homepage to see guides for other systems that can be used with Gource, or try using the custom log format.

Custom Log Format:

If you want to use Gource with something other than the supported systems, there is a pipe delimited custom log format:

    timestamp - A unix timestamp of when the update occured.
    username  - The name of the user who made the update.
    type      - Single character for the update type - (A)dded, (M)odified or (D)eleted.
    file      - Path of the file updated.
    colour    - A colour for the file in hex (FFFFFF) format. Optional.

Interface:

The time shown in the top left of the screen is set initially from the first log entry read and is incremented
according to the simulation speed (--seconds-per-day).

Pressing SPACE at any time will pause/unpause the simulation. While paused you may use the mouse to inspect the
detail of individual files and users.

TAB cycles through selecting the current visible users.

The camera mode, either tracking activity, or showing the entire code tree, can be toggled using the V key.

Interactive keyboard commands:

    (V)   Toggle camera mode
    (C)   Displays Gource logo
    (N)   Jump forward in time to next log entry.
    (+)   Increase simulation speed.
    (-)   Decrease simulation speed.
    (TAB) Cycle through visible users
    (ESC) Quit

4. Building Gource
==================

The source code to Gource is available from the homepage.

Gource requires the following libraries to compile:

    SDL 1.2 (libsdl1.2-dev)
    SDL Image 1.2 (libsdl-image1.2-dev)
    PCRE3 (libpcre3-dev)
    FTGL 2.1.3~rc5-2 (libftgl-dev)
    PNG library (libpng12-dev)
    JPEG library (libjpeg62-dev)

Building on Linux:

    ./configure 
    make
    make install

If you are unfamilar with configure try reading the INSTALL file.

Building on Windows:

On Windows I recommend compiling the project gource.win32.cbp
with the Code Blocks IDE (www.codeblocks.org).

5. Changes
==========

0.15:
 * Added --max-file-lag option to limit how long after a commit file changes can take to appear.
 * Added --no-renames to the git log command as they don't display correctly.
 * Added --max-user-speed and --user-friction as options.
 * Now builds on OSX Leopard (with the required libaries installed).
 * Caught raw exception from replace_invalid().
 * Added CXXFLAGS. You may want to override the default (eg CXXFLAGS=-O3 ./configure).

0.14:
 * Updated SVN instructions.

0.13:
 * Removed single quotes from log command (fixes running gource --git-log-command in back ticks)
 * Added SVN instructions.
 * Fixed manpage hyphens.

0.12:
 * Added --enable-ttf-font-dir=DIR option to configure (to specify the ttf-freefont directory).
 * UTF-8 support using UTF8-CPP (http://utfcpp.sourceforge.net/).
 * Changed the git log command (see --git-log-command) to require less work to parse.
   Log files generated with the previous git-log command used by gource should continue to work.
 * Allow --seconds-per-day value less than 1.0.
 * Added --git-branch command.
 * Added --loop command.
 * Added --crop command.

0.11:
 * Made N key skip to next entry.
 * Documented --user-image-dir flag.
 * temp file name now uses uid instead of time

0.1:
 * First release.
