.SH GIT EXAMPLES

View the log of the Git respository in the current path:

.ti 10
\fIgource\fR

View the log of a Git project in the specified directory:

.ti 10
\fIgource\fR my\-project\-dir

Save a copy of the log using in a special git-log format and play it back. Use \-\-git-log-command to get the git-log options you should use:

.ti 10
cd my\-git\-project
.ti 10
\`\fIgource\fR \-\-git\-log\-command\` > my\-git\-project.log
.ti 10
\fIgource\fR my\-git\-project.log

NOTE: \-\-git-log-command assumes you have a recent version of git that supports all the options. You may need to modify the command line to work with an older version (changing %aN to %an for instance).

.SH CVS SUPPORT

You can view CVS projects with gource using the tool cvs-exp (not provided) with the command line specified by the -\-cvs\-exp\-command option:

.ti 10
cd my\-cvs\-project
.ti 10
\`\fIgource\fR \-\-cvs\-exp\-command\` > my\-cvs\-project.log
.ti 10
\fIgource\fR my\-cvs\-project.log

.SH SVN SUPPORT VIA GIT

SVN is not supported directly, however you could can import your project into a Git repository using the 'git svn' command.

The below insturctions will work if your SVN repository has the standard three directories - trunk, tags and branches (Otherwise, see the 'git svn' documentation):

.ti 10
git svn init \-\-stdlayout https://myrepo.example.org/svn my\-repo.git
.ti 10
cd my\-repo.git
.ti 10
git svn fetch

Note that the last command (git svn fetch) can take hours if your repository is large.

You can pull new changes into the Git copy of your SVN repository at any time using the following command:

.ti 10
git svn rebase

.SH SUPPORT FOR OTHER SYSTEMS

Please check the Gource homepage to see guides for other systems that can be used with Gource, or try using the custom log format.

.SH CUSTOM LOG FORMAT

If you want to use Gource with something other than the supported systems, there is a pipe delimited custom log format:

.ti 10
timestamp - A unix timestamp of when the update occured.
.ti 10
username  - The name of the user who made the update.
.ti 10
type      - Single character for the update type - (A)dded, (M)odified or (D)eleted.
.ti 10
file      - Path of the file updated.
.ti 10
colour    - A colour for the file in hex (FFFFFF) format. Optional.

.SH INTERFACE
The time shown in the top left of the screen is set initially from the first log entry read and is incremented according to the simulation speed (\-\-seconds\-per\-day).

Pressing SPACE at any time will pause/unpause the simulation. While paused you may use the mouse to inspect the detail of individual files and users.

TAB cycles through selecting the current visible users.

The camera mode, either tracking activity, or showing the entire code tree, can be toggled using the V key.

Interactive keyboard commands:
.sp
.ti 10
(V)   Toggle camera mode
.ti 10
(C)   Displays Gource logo
.ti 10
(N)   Jump forward in time to next log entry.
.ti 10
(+)   Increase simulation speed.
.ti 10
(-)   Decrease simulation speed.
.ti 10
(TAB) Cycle through visible users
.ti 10
(ESC) Quit
